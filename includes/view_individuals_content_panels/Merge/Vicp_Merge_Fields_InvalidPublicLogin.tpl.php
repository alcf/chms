<h3>Merge Records</h3>

<div class="section">
	<p>Unfortunately, you cannot merge <strong><?php _p($_CONTROL->objPerson->Name); ?></strong> and <strong><?php _p($_CONTROL->objPersonMergeWith->Name); ?></strong> together because both
	records have a current <strong>my.alcf.net</strong> account.  Please contact this person directly to find out which <strong>my.alcf.net</strong> account is valid / needs to be kept, and then
	delete the other one.</p>
	
	<p>After that, you may proceed with merging the records together.</p>
</div>
