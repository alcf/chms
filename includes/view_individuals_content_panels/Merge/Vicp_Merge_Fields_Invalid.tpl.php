<h3>Merge Records</h3>

<div class="section">
	<p>Unfortunately, you cannot merge <strong><?php _p($_CONTROL->objPerson->Name); ?></strong> and <strong><?php _p($_CONTROL->objPersonMergeWith->Name); ?></strong> together because the
	resulting merged record would have a head-of-household as part of another household.</p>
