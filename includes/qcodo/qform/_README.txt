The various QForm-related classes in this directory are customizations
to certain form and control classes that are part of the Qcodo framework.

It allows you to define global settings for your controls (e.g. all QTextBox
instances should by default be rendered with the CSS class "textbox").  And
specifically in the QControl.inc file, you will be able to define any global
renderers (e.g. RenderWithName).

Feel free to make any changes to these customizations as you wish.

And also, any additional QControl classes that you create or download should
be installed in this directory.
