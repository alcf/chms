The qcodo/ directory contains the bulk of the classes and other related
includes files for the Qcodo Development Framework.  In general,
developers are encouraged to make modifications to any of the files
outside of _core.  The structure of Qcodo is architected in a way such
that modifications to class and file defintions outside of _core will
override the functionality residing in _core.

In a similar approach, note that any folders and files within the
_core/ subdirectory is intended NOT to be edited or altered.
Modifications to those files are typically only done for bug fixes
and enhancements to the core framework, itself.
