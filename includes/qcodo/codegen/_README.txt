The two codegen-related classes in this directory are customizations
to the associated QCodeGenBase and QConvertNotationBase classes that are part
of the Qcodo codegen framework.

It allows you to override the functionality in these classes, as well as
define additional methods/functionality for the code generator and the 
notation converter.

Feel free to make any changes to these customizations as you wish.

NOTE: the templates subdirectory is available for you to place customizations to the templates
and subtemplates themselves.  Read the _README.txt file in templates/ to find out more.
