	/**
	 * This is a MetaControl customizable subclass, providing a QForm or QPanel access to event handlers
	 * and QControls to perform the Create, Edit, and Delete functionality of the
	 * StewardshipPost class.  This code-generated class extends from
	 * the generated MetaControl class, which contains all the basic elements to help a QPanel or QForm
	 * display an HTML form that can manipulate a single StewardshipPost object.
	 *
	 * To take advantage of some (or all) of these control objects, you
	 * must create a new QForm or QPanel which instantiates a StewardshipPostMetaControl
	 * class.
	 *
	 * This file is intended to be modified.  Subsequent code regenerations will NOT modify
	 * or overwrite this file.
