	<span style="font-size: 12px;">
		Classified Acts is designed to inform and inspire the congregation to new levels of caring for, and sharing with, one another, as was the Spirit-inspired custom of the early church as described in the book of Acts. Postings in Classified Acts are opportunities for service and caring, meeting real needs in the fellowship and in the Bay Area community.
